<h1>Phonebook Application: A Python-Based Contact Management System with Visualization and Data Validation</h1>

The Phonebook Application is a contact management, desktop-based system featuring an intuitive, user-friendly environment for storing, managing, and analyzing contact information. This application will be built using Python as the programming language and the Tkinter library to create the GUI. It performs most CRUD operations such as creating, reading, updating, and Deleting on a lightweight database in the form of a CSV file.

The main features of the application are the Adding, Searching, Updating, and Deleting of a contact by either name, phone number, gender, or area. On the application, visualization is implemented, which can view gender distribution within any given area using graphs. The application also has strict data validation, such as detecting duplicate telephone numbers to avoid corrupting this data.

It achieves functionality and aesthetic appeal by utilizing the power of visualization libraries like Matplotlib, coupled with the modular design of Tkinter for interactive elements. This project would be ideal for individuals or small organizations that need an efficient, portable, visually appealing way to handle contact information without the hassle of complex database systems.
